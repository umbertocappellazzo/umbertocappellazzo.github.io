    Super happy to share that I will join <a href="https://jsalt2023.univ-lemans.fr/en/index.html">JSALT 2023</a> in Le Mans, France this summer!
    I will be part of the "Finite state methods with modern neural Architectures for speech applications and beyond" group.
    I will be working with people from Google and rev.com, among others.
