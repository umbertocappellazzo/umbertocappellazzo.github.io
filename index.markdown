Howdy! I'm Umberto Cappellazzo, a second-year PhD student at the University of Trento, Italy, advised by Daniele Falavigna and Alessio Brutti. I'm a member of the [SpeechTek](https://speechtek.fbk.eu/) group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento. My research activity lies at the intersection of **Continual Learning** (CL) and **speech-related** tasks, such as _Spoken Language Understanding_ (SLU) and _Automatic Speech Recognition_ (ASR). Currently, I'm focusing on how to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (the tendency of deep NNs to fit the current data distribution to the detriment of the previous acquired knowledge) for seq2seq enc-dec joint SLU/ASR models, as well as studying how forgetting impacts on multi-modal scenarios (e.g., audio-text and audio-vision).
